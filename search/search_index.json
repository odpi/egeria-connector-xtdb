Conformance indicates that the repository behaves precisely as expected for an Egeria repository. Performance Test Suite ( PTS ) \u00b6 The Performance Test Suite ( PTS ) focuses on measuring the performance of the various operations of an Egeria repository. It does not do as thorough checking of every individual result as the CTS , but instead ensures a consistent volume of metadata exists in the environment for the duration of the tests and records various metrics about both these volumes and the individual runtimes of each execution (in milliseconds) of the various metadata repository operations. Details on the performance metrics The median of all results for that method across all executions for a given set of volume parameters is given (all times in milliseconds) to give an idea of the \"typical\" result, while limiting potential skew from significant outliers. A more detailed set of statistics is best reviewed through the Jupyter Notebook provided in each results directory, where you can review: the full distributions of execution times (including the outliers) detailed individual outlier results (e.g. the top-10 slowest response times per method) volumes in place during the tests (how many entities, how many relationships, etc) The volume parameters that were used for each test are specified using the convention i-s , where i is the value for the instancesPerType parameter to the PTS and s is the value for maxSearchResults . For example, 5-2 means 5 instances will be created for every open metadata type and 2 will be the maximum number of results per page for methods that include paging. All tests are run from 5-2 through 20-10 to give a sense of the performance impact of doubling the number of instances and search results. Above this, the graph queries are no longer included: they become exponentially more complex as the volumes grow, and while they will still return results, the depth of their testing in the PTS means that they can contribute many hours (or even days) to the overall suite execution -- they are therefore left out to be able to more quickly produce results for the other methods at progressively higher volumes. The page size is left at a maximum of 10 for subsequent tests so that it is only the volume of instances in total that are doubling each time, rather than also the number of detailed results. Instance counts range from a few thousand (at 5-2 ) up to nearly one hundred thousand (at 80-10 ). In the graphical comparisons, a point plot is used to show the typical execution time of each method at the different volumes / by repository. Each point on the plot represents the median execution time for that method, at a given volume of metadata. (For the repository comparison plots, pts = Crux and janus = JanusGraph.) The horizontal lines that appear around each point are confidence intervals calculated by a bootstrapping process: in simple terms, the larger the horizontal line, the more variability there is for that particular method's execution time (a singular median value is insufficient to represent such variability on its own). Reproducibility \u00b6 Re-running the tests \u00b6 The cts/charts directory contains a Helm chart to automate the execution of these suites against a Crux repository connector, to reproduce these results. These use a default configuration for the Crux repository where Lucene is used as a text index and RocksDB is used for all persistence: index store, document store and transaction log. No additional tuning of any parameters (Crux or RocksDB) is applied: they use all of their default settings.

PTS results \u00b6 Crux at varying volumes \u00b6 Summary The retrieval and write operations remain very consistent, with almost no variability, throughout the growth in volume. The search operations, however, begin to clearly degrade at the highest volumes tested. Further investigation into other optimized settings for the search operations for these larger volumes is likely warranted as the next step to continue to improve performance.

For JanusGraph, on the other hand, there is significant variability (in particular for methods like findEntitiesByClassification ), and there are numerous examples of the median execution time taking more than multiple seconds. Even at 8 times the volume of metadata the Crux connector still outperforms the JanusGraph connector in almost every method (the only exceptions being a few of the find methods, where the performance is approximately even at 2-4 times the volume). Graph queries were disabled for JanusGraph The graph queries were disabled for JanusGraph in order to have results in a timely manner: it would take more than a month to produce results for these queries for the JanusGraph connector. The Crux results can be difficult to see in detail due to the skew from the Janus results, so it may be easier to look at this more granular comparison that drops the higher scales of Janus for readability of the Crux results: Profile Method 05-02 (Crux) 05-02 (Janus) 10-05 (Crux) 10-05 (Janus) 20-10 (Crux) 20-10 (Janus) 40-10 (Crux) 40-10 (Janus) 80-10 (Crux) 80-10 (Janus) Entity creation

For JanusGraph, on the other hand, there is significant variability (in particular for methods like findEntitiesByClassification ), and there are numerous examples of the median execution time taking more than multiple seconds.

Graph queries were disabled for JanusGraph The graph queries were disabled for JanusGraph in order to have results in a timely manner: it would take more than a month to produce results for these queries for the JanusGraph connector. The Crux results can be difficult to see in detail due to the skew from the Janus results, so it may be easier to look at this more granular comparison that drops the higher scales of Janus for

For JanusGraph, on the other hand, there is significant variability (in particular for methods like findEntitiesByClassification ), and there are numerous examples of the median execution time taking more than multiple seconds. Even at 8 times the volume of metadata the Crux connector still outperforms the JanusGraph connector in almost every method (the only exceptions being a few of the find methods, where the performance is approximately even at 2-4 times the volume). Graph queries were disabled for JanusGraph The graph queries were disabled for JanusGraph in order to have results in a timely manner: it would take more than a month to produce results for these queries for the JanusGraph connector. The Crux results can be difficult to see in detail due to the skew from the Janus results, so it may be easier to look at this more granular comparison that drops the higher scales of Janus for

For JanusGraph, on the other hand, there is significant variability (in particular for methods like findEntitiesByClassification ), and there are numerous examples of the median execution time taking more than multiple seconds. Even at 8 times the volume of metadata the Crux connector still outperforms the JanusGraph connector in almost every method (the only exceptions being a few of the find methods, where the performance is approximately even at 2-4 times the volume). Graph queries were disabled for JanusGraph The graph queries were disabled for JanusGraph in order to have results in a timely manner: it would take more than a month to produce results for these queries for the JanusGraph connector. The Crux results can be difficult to see in detail due to the skew from the Janus results, so it may be easier to look at this more granular comparison that drops the higher scales of Janus for readability of the Crux results: Profile Method 05-02 (Crux) 05-02 (Janus) 10-05 (Crux) 10-05 (Janus) 20-10 (Crux) 20-10 (Janus) 40-10 (Crux) 40-10 (Janus) 80-10 (Crux) 80-10 (Janus) Entity creation

For JanusGraph, on the other hand, there is significant variability (in particular for methods like findEntitiesByClassification ), and there are numerous examples of the median execution time taking more than multiple seconds. Even at 8 times the volume of metadata the Crux connector still outperforms the JanusGraph connector in almost every method (the only exceptions being a few of the find methods, where the performance is approximately even at 2-4 times the volume). Graph queries were disabled for JanusGraph The graph queries were disabled for JanusGraph in order to have results in a timely manner: it would take more than a month to produce results for these queries for the JanusGraph connector. The Crux results can be difficult to see in detail due to the skew from the Janus results, so it may be easier to look at this more granular comparison that drops the higher scales of Janus for readability of the Crux results: Profile Method 05-02 (Crux) 05-02 (Janus) 10-05 (Crux) 10-05 (Janus) Entity creation addEntity 51.0 434.0 45.0 466.5 ... saveEntityReferenceCopy 48.0 440.5 42.0 469.0 Entity search findEntities 48.0 224.0 50.5 402.0 ... findEntitiesByProperty 34.0 36.0 31.0 48.0 ... findEntitiesByPropertyValue 52.0 73.0 60.0 90.0 Relationship creation addRelationship 47.0 151.0 42.0 154.5 ... saveRelationshipReferenceCopy 49.0 424.0 44.0 461.5 Relationship search findRelationships 26.0 40.0 26.0 60.0 ... findRelationshipsByProperty 34.0 39.0 29.0 57.0 ... findRelationshipsByPropertyValue 42.0 66.0 53.0 88.0 Entity classification classifyEntity 74.0 873.0 69.0 865.0 ... saveClassificationReferenceCopy 65.0 731.0 56.0 801.5 Classification search findEntitiesByClassification 37.0 545.0 39.0 917.5 Entity update reTypeEntity 51.0 382.0 40.0 369.0 ... updateEntityProperties 54.0 759.0 49.0 723.0 Relationship update updateRelationshipProperties 60.0 422.0 50.0 418.0 Classification update updateEntityClassification 92.0 1191.0 83.0 1187.0 Entity undo undoEntityUpdate 52.0 -- 43.0 -- Relationship undo undoRelationshipUpdate 57.0 -- 48.0 -- Entity retrieval getEntityDetail 16.0 18.0 14.0 17.0 ... getEntitySummary 17.0 17.0 15.0 17.0 ... isEntityKnown 17.0 18.0 15.0 17.0 Entity history retrieval getEntityDetail 20.0 -- 17.0 -- ... getEntityDetailHistory 22.0 -- 19.0 -- Relationship retrieval getRelationship 18.0 19.0 15.0 19.0 ... isRelationshipKnown 18.0 20.0 16.0 19.0 Relationship history retrieval getRelationship 21.0 -- 19.0 -- ... getRelationshipHistory 22.0 -- 20.0 -- Entity history search findEntities 64.0 -- 76.5 -- ... findEntitiesByProperty 31.0 -- 31.0 -- ... findEntitiesByPropertyValue 54.0 -- 69.0 -- Relationship history search findRelationships 28.0 -- 30.0 -- ... findRelationshipsByProperty 31.0 -- 37.0 -- ... findRelationshipsByPropertyValue 55.0 -- 75.0 -- Graph queries getEntityNeighborhood 27.0 -- 24.0 -- ... getLinkingEntities 21.0 -- 23.0 -- ... getRelatedEntities 546.0 -- 871.0 -- ... getRelationshipsForEntity 26.0 -- 24.0 -- Graph history queries getEntityNeighborhood 27.0 -- 23.0 -- ... getLinkingEntities 21.0 -- 23.0 -- ... getRelatedEntities 548.5 -- 875.0 -- ... getRelationshipsForEntity 24.0 -- 22.0 -- Entity re-home reHomeEntity 58.5 731.5 43.0 722.0 Relationship re-home reHomeRelationship 56.0 363.0 39.0 358.0 Entity declassify declassifyEntity 80.0 1225.5 56.0 1308.0 ... purgeClassificationReferenceCopy 65.0 -- 50.0 -- Entity re-identify reIdentifyEntity 61.0 1711.0 48.0 1725.5 Relationship re-identify reIdentifyRelationship 50.0 779.0 40.0 799.5 Relationship delete deleteRelationship 48.0 362.0 37.0 375.0 Entity delete deleteEntity 56.0 738.0 42.0 763.0 Entity restore restoreEntity 44.0 769.0 37.0 815.0 Relationship restore restoreRelationship 43.0 339.0 33.0 380.0 Relationship purge purgeRelationship 38.0 125.0 28.0 162.5 ... purgeRelationshipReferenceCopy 28.0 104.0 21.0 100.0 Entity purge purgeEntity 55.0 234.0 35.0 315.0 ... purgeEntityReferenceCopy 32.0 243.0 21.0 218.0","title":"3.0"},{"location":"cts/3.0/#release-30","text":"","title":"Release 3.0"},{"location":"cts/3.0/#cts-results","text":"The 3.0 release is fully conformant with all Egeria profiles Profile Result Connector Egeria Crux Metadata sharing CONFORMANT_FULL_SUPPORT 3.0 3.0 1.18.1 Reference copies CONFORMANT_FULL_SUPPORT 3.0 3.0 1.18.1 Metadata maintenance CONFORMANT_FULL_SUPPORT 3.0 3.0 1.18.1 Dynamic types UNKNOWN_STATUS 3.0 3.0 1.18.1 Graph queries CONFORMANT_FULL_SUPPORT 3.0 3.0 1.18.1 Historical search CONFORMANT_FULL_SUPPORT 3.0 3.0 1.18.1 Entity proxies CONFORMANT_FULL_SUPPORT 3.0 3.0 1.18.1 Soft-delete and restore CONFORMANT_FULL_SUPPORT 3.0 3.0 1.18.1 Undo an update CONFORMANT_FULL_SUPPORT 3.0 3.0 1.18.1 Reidentify instance CONFORMANT_FULL_SUPPORT 3.0 3.0 1.18.1 Retype instance CONFORMANT_FULL_SUPPORT 3.0 3.0 1.18.1 Rehome instance CONFORMANT_FULL_SUPPORT 3.0 3.0 1.18.1 Entity search CONFORMANT_FULL_SUPPORT 3.0 3.0 1.18.1 Relationship search CONFORMANT_FULL_SUPPORT 3.0 3.0 1.18.1 Entity advanced search CONFORMANT_FULL_SUPPORT 3.0 3.0 1.18.1 Relationship advanced search CONFORMANT_FULL_SUPPORT 3.0 3.0 1.18.1 Additional notes The entity search tests could fail a particular long-running query pattern unless Lucene is configured: typically where a query by value or attribute is done without providing any restriction on the type of instances against which the query should run.

Summary \u00b6 In conclusion, with the Crux plugin repository we now have the ability to both store and retrieve historical metadata. We have illustrated the simple case of retrieval by ID, but the same works for all metadata access: searching, retrieving relationships through the graph queries, etc. This is all easily accomplished through Crux's native support for temporal queries: the underlying API to the Crux storage layer is as simple as passing a date (for a view of that point-in-time) or not passing a date (for the current view). The \"view\" itself applies against the entire database: so everything we retrieve from that point-in-time is referentially-intact per that point-in-time.","title":"Explore"},{"location":"getting-started/explore/#explore","text":"Once a connector instance is up and running, you should now be able to start interacting with the repository.

Obtain connector \u00b6 Start by downloading the Crux repository connector: Latest release Latest snapshot The connector is: egeria-connector-crux-{version}-jar-with-dependencies.jar 2. Obtain OMAG Server Platform \u00b6 Download Egeria's OMAG Server Platform: Latest release Latest snapshot The connector version indicates the minimum required Egeria version The OMAG Server Platform is: server-chassis-spring-{version}.jar OMAG Server Platform The OMAG Server Platform is a runtime process for Open Metadata and Governance services like the metadata server that we will configure and run through the steps below. 3. Configure security \u00b6 To get an initial environment up-and-running just download the truststore.p12 file from: https://github.com/odpi/egeria/raw/master/truststore.p12 . Transport-level security The truststore.p12 file provides a local truststore for Java. This allows the self-signed certificate embedded within the OMAG Server Platform (by default) to be trusted. Without this trust, interactions with the OMAG Server Platform (such as the REST calls that are made through Java to handle interaction between the Platform and the connector) will result in an SSLHandshakeException . While this truststore.p12 file allows SSL-encrypted communication, the fact that it relies on a self-signed certificate means that there is no independent source of trust in the interactions (which would typically be achieved through an independent Certificate Authority). Additional details on TLS for Egeria can be found in the Egeria documentation . 4. Start the OMAG Server Platform \u00b6 Ensure the 3 files are in the same directory, and run: java -Dloader.path = . -jar server-chassis-spring-*.jar Explanation of the command The -Dloader.path=. indicates that the OMAG Server Platform should look for any connectors in the current directory. If you wanted to instead place the connector in a separate location (for example /lib ), you could change the . to point to that other location ( -Dloader.path=/lib ).

Any attempt to configure the OMAG Server Platform before these lines are output is likely to result in failures. 5. Configure the metadata server \u00b6 curl -k -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ --data '{\"class\":\"Connection\",\"connectorType\":{\"class\":\"ConnectorType\",\"connectorProviderClassName\":\"org.odpi.egeria.connectors.juxt.crux.repositoryconnector.CruxOMRSRepositoryConnectorProvider\"}}' \\ \"https://localhost:9443/open-metadata/admin-services/users/admin/servers/crux/local-repository/mode/plugin-repository/connection\" Detailed explanation A metadata server is an OMAG server that hosts a metadata repository with native support for open metadata types and instances. This API call configures Crux as the repository for the metadata server. The URL to which we post indicates that we will use the Egeria OMAG Server Platform's built-in repository plugin capability to enable Crux as the metadata server's repository. The JSON payload's contents define how this plugin itself should be configured: specifically, which Java class should be used for the repository connection. Here we can see the payload refers to the CruxOMRSRepositoryConnectorProvider , which therefore tells the plugin to use this class -- specific to the Crux repository plugin -- in order to configure its repository connection. Response from metadata server configuration { \"class\" : \"VoidResponse\" , \"relatedHTTPCode\" : 200 } The default configuration is for an in-memory (non-persistent) repository The default configuration used in this example will startup the Crux repository in a completely embedded, in-memory-only mode. No data will be persisted, so if you stop or restart the OMAG Server Platform all data will be lost. While this is actually beneficial for quick experimentation and testing purposes, it is naturally not desirable for a \"real\" repository: you'd want your metadata to stick around even when the server goes offline. Additional options for configuring Crux , including with persistence, can be found at the end of this page. 6. Start the metadata server \u00b6 curl -k -X POST \"https://localhost:9443/open-metadata/admin-services/users/admin/servers/crux/instance\" Detailed explanation Up to this point we have only configured the metadata server, but have not actually started it. This final API call tells Egeria to start the metadata server, based on the configuration the previous API calls defined. Response from metadata server startup { \"class\" : \"SuccessMessageResponse\" , \"relatedHTTPCode\" : 200 , \"successMessage\" : \"Fri Feb 12 20:34:16 GMT 2021 crux is running the following services: [Open Metadata Repository Services (OMRS)]\" } It may take 10-15 seconds to complete, but the example response above indicates that the metadata server is now running. Other startup information of potential interest Back in the console where the OMAG Server Platform is running, you should see the audit log printing out a large amount of information as the startup is running. Most of this is related to the registration of type definition details with the repository.

To enable persistence, send in the JSON document configuration outlined in Crux's own documentation directly to the cruxConfig key of the configurationProperties property of Egeria's connector configuration: Example persistent configuration 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 { \"class\" : \"Connection\" , \"connectorType\" : { \"class\" : \"ConnectorType\" , \"connectorProviderClassName\" : \"org.odpi.egeria.connectors.juxt.crux.repositoryconnector.CruxOMRSRepositoryConnectorProvider\" }, \"configurationProperties\" : { \"cruxConfig\" : { \"crux.lucene/lucene-store\" : { \"db-dir\" : \"data/servers/crux/lucene\" }, \"crux/index-store\" : { \"kv-store\" : { \"crux/module\" : \"crux.rocksdb/->kv-store\" , \"db-dir\" : \"data/servers/crux/rdb-index\" } }, \"crux/document-store\" : { \"kv-store\" : { \"crux/module\" : \"crux.rocksdb/->kv-store\" , \"db-dir\" : \"data/servers/crux/rdb-docs\" } }, \"crux/tx-log\" : { \"kv-store\" : { \"crux/module\" : \"crux.rocksdb/->kv-store\" , \"db-dir\" : \"data/servers/crux/rdb-tx\" } } } } } Some of the Lucene configuration will be automatically injected In the example above, lines 9-11 configure Crux's built-in Lucene index. You should be aware that some additional entries will be automatically injected by Egeria: specifically the indexer and analyzer entries used to configure the Lucene index optimally for the OMRS -level search interfaces that Egeria defines. If you have defined your own analyzer or indexer in the configuration, these will be overridden by the connector's injection process -- in other words, any custom configuration you attempt for analyzer or indexer will be ignored. It is highly recommended to include the Lucene entry like that above as it offers significant performance improvements for any text-based queries. The remainder of the configuration in this example defines RocksDB to act as the persistence layer for Crux's index and document stores, as well as its transaction log. You may need to download additional dependencies Depending on the persistence you choose to use, you may need to download additional dependencies and place them into the same directory as the connector. For example, when using RocksDB you will need the following: pro.juxt.crux:crux-rocksdb org.rocksdb:rocksdbjni com.github.jnr:jnr-ffi You can generally determine the additional dependencies you will need by looking at the project.clj file of relevant Crux module -- specifically its :dependencies section. For example, sticking with RocksDB, here is the project.clj : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 ( defproject pro.juxt.crux/crux-rocksdb \"crux-git-version\" :description \"Crux RocksDB\" :plugins [[ lein-parent \"0.3.8\" ]] :parent-project { :path \"../project.clj\" :inherit [ :repositories :deploy-repositories :managed-dependencies :pedantic? :global-vars :license :url :pom-addition ]} :scm { :dir \"..\" } :dependencies [[ org.clojure/clojure \"1.10.3\" ] [ pro.juxt.crux/crux-core \"crux-git-version\" ] [ pro.juxt.crux/crux-metrics \"crux-git-version\" :scope \"provided\" ] [ org.rocksdb/rocksdbjni \"6.12.7\" ] [ com.github.jnr/jnr-ffi \"2.1.12\" ]] :middleware [ leiningen.project-version/middleware ]) Note that its dependencies include org.rocksdb:rocksdbjni and com.github.jnr:jnr-ffi . The third dependency given in the previous slide is this Crux persistence module itself ( pro.juxt.crux:crux-rocksdb ). Connector options \u00b6 There are currently two configuration options for the connector itself: Option Description luceneRegexes Controls whether the connector will interpret unquoted regexes as Lucene-compatible (true) or not (false): in the latter case ensuring that we fallback to full Java regex checking (which will be significantly slower). syncIndex Controls whether the connector will wait for the Crux indexes to be updated before returning from write operations (true) or only that they are transactionally persisted (false).

While this truststore.p12 file allows SSL-encrypted communication, the fact that it relies on a self-signed certificate means that there is no independent source of trust in the interactions (which would typically be achieved through an independent Certificate Authority).

This API call configures Crux as the repository for the metadata server. The URL to which we post indicates that we will use the Egeria OMAG Server Platform's built-in repository plugin capability to enable Crux as the metadata server's repository. The JSON payload's contents define how this plugin itself should be configured: specifically, which Java class should be used for the repository connection. Here we can see the payload refers to the CruxOMRSRepositoryConnectorProvider , which therefore tells the plugin to use this class -- specific to the Crux repository plugin -- in order to configure its repository connection. Response from metadata server configuration { \"class\" : \"VoidResponse\" , \"relatedHTTPCode\" : 200 } The default configuration is for an in-memory (non-persistent) repository The default configuration used in this example will startup the Crux repository in a completely embedded, in-memory-only mode. No data will be persisted, so if you stop or restart the OMAG Server Platform all data will be lost. While this is actually beneficial for quick experimentation and testing purposes, it is naturally not desirable for a \"real\" repository: you'd want your metadata to stick around even when the server goes offline. Additional options for configuring Crux , including with persistence, can be found at the end of this page.","title":"5.

Other startup information of potential interest Back in the console where the OMAG Server Platform is running, you should see the audit log printing out a large amount of information as the startup is running.

While we try to keep this underlying storage unchanged as much as possible to ease moving from one version of the connector to another, this is not always possible. It may therefore be necessary to occasionally migrate any pre-existing metadata stored in the embedded Crux repository in order to make use of the latest features and performance benefits of a new version of the connector. Persistence layer version must be compatible with connector version To ensure the integrity of the metadata, the connector will validate that the version of the persistence matches the version the connector expects before even attempting to run -- if this validation fails, you will see an OMRS-CRUX-REPOSITORY-500-003 error in the audit log to indicate that you must first migrate the metadata before running this version of the connector. In other words: if migration is needed, the newer version of the connector will not allow you to run against an older set of metadata without first running the migration. Your only options will be to continue to use an older version of the connector (with which your pre-existing metadata is compatible), or to run this offline migration of your repository and then run the newer version of the connector. The migration itself runs outside the connector (while the connector is offline), in order to maximize the throughput of the in-place upgrade of the repository. The time it takes to run the migration naturally depends on a number of factors, such as the amount of pre-existing metadata that must be migrated and the specific changes needed by the upgrade. As a very approximate metric, we would expect the in-place upgrade to be capable of migrating 60-100 metadata instances (entities or relationships) per second.

Obtain migrator \u00b6 Start by downloading the Crux repository migrator: Latest release Latest snapshot The migrator is egeria-connector-crux-migrator-{version}-jar-with-dependencies.jar 2. Configure repository \u00b6 Before running the migrator, define the configuration of your repository. The configuration must be defined in a JSON file, following Crux's JSON configuration format . Take Crux configuration from Egeria connector configuration The simplest way to ensure this matches the configuration used by your connector is to copy the cruxConfig property from the request you POST to Egeria to configure your connector. Simply be certain to replace any relative paths with absolute paths to data to ensure the migrator can find the metadata.

Make a backup \u00b6 As the migration runs in-place, it is always a good practice to take a backup of your repository first. Different configurations will require different approaches to backup. If your configuration makes use of pluggable components that have their own backup utilities (Kafka, JDBC, etc) then you should follow the best practices for backing up those components themselves: e.g. from Apache Kafka or the database vendor. For pluggable components that persist their data directly to the filesystem (RocksDB, Lucene, LMDB, etc), you may be able to simply backup the files directly. Ensure connector is not running before taking backup In all cases, you should ensure that your connector is shutdown (not running), and that any data is appropriately quiesced prior to running the backup. Example filesystem backup $ tar cvf backup.tar .../data/servers/crux a .../data/servers/crux a .../data/servers/crux/rdb-index a .../data/servers/crux/lucene a .../data/servers/crux/config a .../data/servers/crux/cohorts a .../data/servers/crux/rdb-tx a .../data/servers/crux/rdb-docs ... 4.

If you run the migrator and no migration is actually needed, the output will indicate that your repository is already at the necessary version to work with this version of the connector, and no migration is needed. You can simply proceed with running the connector. Example output when no migration is needed Starting a Crux node using configuration: config.json SLF4J: Failed to load class \"org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder\". SLF4J: Defaulting to no-operation (NOP) logger implementation SLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#StaticLoggerBinder for further details. ... checking if migration is needed (crux.api.java.JCruxNode@25c4bb06) This node is already at the latest version of the persistence layer -- no migration needed. If a migration is necessary, it will immediately begin to run. The output will indicate the existing version of the persistence layer, and the version that is expected by this version of the connector.
